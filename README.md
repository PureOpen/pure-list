## Project Introduction

**PureOpen** is an organization dedicated to maintaining and protecting truly open source projects. Through the **pure-list** project, we collect and promote projects that uphold the pure open source spirit, safeguarding the interests of developers and contributors, and protecting the integrity of the open source world.

In the current open source environment, many projects fly the "open source" flag while actually paving the way for commercialization, using developers' enthusiasm and contributions as stepping stones for corporate growth. PureOpen aims to identify and promote projects that truly follow the open source spirit, providing developers and users with a reliable reference list.

## Our Mission

1. **Curate Pure Open Source Projects**: Strictly screen and promote projects that truly uphold the open source spirit, attracting talented developers to participate in maintenance
2. **Connect Developers with Quality Projects**: Help developers and entrepreneurs find the best open source solutions in various fields
3. **Promote Open Source Contributions**: Encourage users to contribute to the projects they use, forming a positive open source ecosystem
4. **Uphold Open Source Principles**: Refuse to include "pseudo-open source" projects that plan for commercialization from the start, protecting the rights of open source contributors
5. **Maintain Neutrality and Objectivity**: Reject any projects with political leanings, focusing on the transmission of technology and open source spirit
