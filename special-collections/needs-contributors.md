# Projects in Need of Contributors

This page features valuable open source projects that urgently need more contributors. These projects may be facing maintainer shortages, require domain experts, or are undergoing significant upgrades that require additional support.

## Why These Projects Matter

Projects in need of contributors often:
- Solve important problems for their users
- Have established codebases with real-world impact
- Risk becoming unmaintained without community support
- Offer excellent opportunities to make meaningful contributions
- Provide greater visibility for your work compared to heavily-contributed projects

## Types of Contributions Needed

These projects typically need help with:

1. **Code Maintenance** - Bug fixes, dependency updates, and technical debt reduction
2. **Documentation** - Improving guides, API references, and examples
3. **Testing** - Expanding test coverage and improving test infrastructure
4. **Feature Development** - Implementing requested features and enhancements
5. **Community Support** - Helping with issue triage, code reviews, and user support

## How to Approach These Projects

When contributing to projects in need:
1. Start by introducing yourself to the maintainers
2. Ask about their most pressing needs
3. Begin with smaller contributions to build familiarity
4. Consider making a long-term commitment if the project aligns with your interests
